**This repository is focused on strengthening logical thinking and mathematical problem-solving skills using Java.**

The primary objective of this project is to build a strong foundation in:

Core Java programming

Mathematical algorithm implementation

Logical reasoning

Interview-focused coding preparation

This project contains well-structured Java programs covering basic to advanced mathematical concepts commonly asked in coding interviews.

Develop strong problem-solving abilities.

Improve algorithmic thinking.

Understand time and space complexity.

Prepare for technical interviews.

Master mathematical logic implementation without relying on built-in shortcuts.

This repository is ideal for students, beginners, and MCA learners who want to improve their core logic-building skills.
